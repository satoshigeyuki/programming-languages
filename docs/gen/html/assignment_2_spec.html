  <h1>Programming Languages<br />Assignment 1 Details <font color="red">(you are not done only with coding)</font></h1>

<h2>Corrections and clarifications</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Excel contained a typo, which I correct as follows with apology
      <p>
        <img src="img/typo.png" width="1000" />
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Jupyter notebook contained several unclear phrases and words,
      which I clarify with
      <a href="pl06_memory_management_measurement_correction_and_clarification.sos.html">this page</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<div>
  <p>You collaborate with team members.  Here are responsibilities of you and your group.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Each member submits your notebook through Jupyter by pressing the
        <font color="blue">"Submit"</font> button of
        <strike>pl05_calculator</strike>
        <font color="blue">pl06_memory_management</font>
        .
        The notebook does not contain any coding problem, so
        it is mainly for the formality.
        </p>


      <p>
        <img src="img/submit.png" width=500/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Other materials should be submitted by editing collaborative documents (Microsoft Excel/Word) I give to each group.
      A folder named <font color="red"><tt>programming-languages-group-</tt><i>NN</i></font>
      should appear in your OneDrive page's "Shared" folder on the left pane, where <i>NN</i>
        is your group number.  The folder contains a child directory
        <strike><tt>assignment-1</tt></strike>
        <font color="red"><tt>assignment-2</tt></font>,
      which contains two files
        <strike><tt>record.xlsx</tt></strike>
        <font color="red"><tt>record-and-measurements.xlsx</tt></font>
        and <font color="red"><tt>summary-reflection.docx</tt></font>
      </p>

      <p>
        To indicate you are able to access these files, please write your name and student id
        in <font color="red"><tt>work log</tt></font> sheet in
        <strike><tt>record.xlsx</tt></strike>

      <p>A group has to compile records of when each member worked, both individually or with other members into
        <font color="red"><tt>work log</tt></font> sheet in
        <strike><tt>record.xlsx</tt></strike>
        <font color="red"><tt>record-and-measurements.xlsx</tt></font>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group has to gather and have meetings a few times.  They can/should also include meetings in classes (if and only if the group indeed met during a class).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A group has to execute all problems (Problems 1-3) and fill corresponding sheet in the Excel file with experimental results.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>
        <font color="red">(The main part)</font> In the meeting(s),
        discuss questions asked in each problem and put them
        in the <font color="red"><tt>summary-reflection.docx</tt></font>.
      </p>
      <p>

        <font color="green">(added Jun 5th)
          In addition, discuss and explain when/how a node of the tree
          is collected
          (or becomes collectable, in garbage-collected languages)
          during the execution of a program.
          <ul>
            <li>for garbage-collected languages (Go, Julia, OCaml), when
              does a node of the tree become unreachable from the
              root (therefore become collectable)?</li>
            <li>for Rust, when does a node lose its owner pointer
              (therefore is collected)? also confirm that there is
              indeed only a single owner pointer to each (live) node</li>
          </ul>
        </font>
        While I don't impose any page limit,
        I expect it to be two to a few pages.

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        After you have done, each member should send a brief notice to the assignment 2 in
        <a href="https://itc-lms.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2023FEN-EE4d19L10F01" target="_blank">ITC-LMS</a>
        saying something like <font color="red"><i>"we have done all the work specified"</i></font>
        and optionally some nice greetings or remarks.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>It's due <font color="red">June 17th (Sat)</font></li>
    <li>You will have a few opportunities to work on it during classes,
      but it's not that you can finish everything during the class time.
      You are expected to work on it outside the class, and more importantly,
      meet and collaborate with and other group members.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Misconducts</h2>
<div>
  It goes without saying that any of the following constitutes a misconduct.
  
  <ul>
    <li>dishonestly report status of your or another student's work
      (e.g., fill the sheet with the result of experiments not actually done)</li>
    <li>dishonestly report discussions or exchanges that actually did not happen</li>
    <li>discussions report who participated in meetings or writings</li>
  </ul>
</div>
