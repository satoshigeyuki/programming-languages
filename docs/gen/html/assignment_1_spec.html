  <h1>Programming Languages<br />Assignment 1 Details <font color="red">(you are not done only with coding)</font></h1>
<div>
  <font size=-1>(the page is encoded in UTF-8)</font>

  <a href="../..">top</a>
</div>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<div>
  <p>You collaborate with team members.  Here are responsibilities of you and your group.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Each member submits your calculator program through Jupyter by pressing the
      <font color="blue">"Submit"</font> button of <font color="blue">pl05_calculator</font>.
      Make sure you have your source code in the specified directory with the specified names, so I can automatically check them (i.e., do not roll your own file names).</p>


      <p>
        <img src="img/submit.png" width=500/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Other materials should be submitted by editing collaborative documents (Microsoft Excel/Word) I give to each group.
      A folder named <font color="red"><tt>programming-languages-group-</tt><i>NN</i></font>
      should appear in your OneDrive page's "Shared" folder on the left pane, where <i>NN</i>
      is your group number.  The folder contains a child directory <font color="red"><tt>assignment-1</tt></font>,
      which contains two files
        <font color="red"><tt>record.xlsx</tt></font> and <font color="red"><tt>summary-reflection.docx</tt></font>
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="img/onedrive.png" width=500/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      To see these files, you have to sign in Microsoft 365 with UTokyo Account
      (<a href="https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/microsoft/"
          target="_blank">see this page if you don't know how</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        To indicate you are able to access these files, please write your name and student id
        in <font color="red"><tt>work log</tt></font> sheet in <font color="red"><tt>record.xlsx</tt></font>
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="img/work_log.png" width=500/>
      </p>
      
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A group has to compile records of when each member worked, both individually or with other members into
      <font color="red"><tt>work log</tt></font> sheet in <font color="red"><tt>record.xlsx</tt></font>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group has to gather and have meetings a few times.  They can/should also include meetings in classes (if and only if the group indeed met during a class).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In the end, each member has to show other members your source code and if it works (compile and run it before other members).  All members must see how far others went and honestly report what they saw in
        the <font color="red"><tt>check</tt></font> sheet in <font color="red"><tt>record.xlsx</tt></font>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="img/check.png" width=500/>
      </p>

      <p>
      You should select from the following.
      <ul>
        <li><b>no show</b> --- the student did not appear in meetings</li>
        <li><b>no code</b> --- the student participated but could show no or only little code</li>
        <li><b>compile error</b> --- the code was made but it had syntax/static errors, so could not start execution</li>
        <li><b>runtime error</b> --- the code compiled so could start execution, but could not run until the end due to an error during the execution</li>
        <li><b>wrong results</b> --- the code could run until the end but some results were wrong</li>
        <li><b>ok</b> --- the code could produce correct results for all tests</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>
        <font color="red">(The main part)</font> In the meeting(s), exchange and discuss, among others, following topics
        <ul>
          <li>how easy or difficult was it to write it, including what was difficult or which aspect of the language you worked with made it difficult</li>
          <li>how their programs could be improved for clarity, conciseness, performance, etc.</li>
          <li>which aspects of each language make your language more productive or less so</li>
        </ul>
        They should be written to <font color="red"><tt>summary-reflection.docx</tt></font>
        While I don't impose any page limit, I expect it to be two to a few pages.
      </p>

        <img src="img/summary.png" width=500/>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        After you have done, each member should send a brief notice to the assignment 1 in
        <a href="https://itc-lms.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2023FEN-EE4d19L10F01" target="_blank">ITC-LMS</a>
        saying something like <font color="red"><i>"we have done all the work specified"</i></font>
        and optionally some nice greetings or remarks.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
 </div>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>It's due May 27th (Sat)</li>
    <li>You will have a few opportunities to work on it during classes,
      but it's not that you can finish everything during the class time.
      You are expected to work on it outside the class, and more importantly,
      meet and collaborate with and other group members.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Misconducts</h2>
<div>
  It goes without saying that any of the following constitutes a misconduct.
  
  <ul>
    <li>dishonestly report status of your or another student's code
      (e.g., say "ok" when the code in fact does not work)</li>
    <li>dishonestly report your or another student's participation in a meeting
      (e.g., record as if you were in a meeting or a lecture when you in fact weren't)</li>
    <li>dishonestly report discussions or exchanges that actually did not happen</li>
  </ul>
</div>
